Lezgian's agglutinative nature makes possible to isolate the affixes that indicate tense and aspect. Refer to the examples in glosses 

The phrase structure rules are written as follows:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r@{\hskip3pt}l}
        TP &\textrightarrow DP T'  \\
        T' &\textrightarrow $V_{AUX}P$ T \\
        $V_{AUX}P$ &\textrightarrow $V_{AUX}'$ \\
        $V_{AUX}'$ &\textrightarrow VP $V_{AUX}$ \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

As such, it is possible to distinguish $V_{\text{AUX}}$ heads from T heads.
